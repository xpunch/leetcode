```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.
```
## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```
## Follow up:
```
This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
