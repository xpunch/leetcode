Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Result:
```
√ Accepted
  √ 29/29 cases passed (4 ms)
  √ Your runtime beats 100 % of golang submissions
  √ Your memory usage beats 51.62 % of golang submissions (3.7 MB)
