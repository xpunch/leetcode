The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
```

## Note:
* Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
* Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.

## Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
