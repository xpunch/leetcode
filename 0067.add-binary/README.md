```
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.
```
## Example 1:
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## Notes
```
The length of the two binary strings may different, so sum two binary bit when it exist, then sum the binary carry.
Don't forget to add the last bit when binary carry is not zero at the end of the operations.
```
