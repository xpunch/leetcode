Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
```
## Example 1:
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
```
## Example 2:
```
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
```
## Example 3:
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false
```
